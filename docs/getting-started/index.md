# Getting Started

This section will guide you through installing and using Fortified LLM Client for the first time.

## What You'll Learn

- System requirements and prerequisites
- How to install the CLI and library
- Your first LLM interaction
- Basic configuration options

## Quick Navigation

1. **[Prerequisites]({% link getting-started/prerequisites.md %})** - Check system requirements
2. **[Installation]({% link getting-started/installation.md %})** - Build from source
3. **[Quick Start]({% link getting-started/quick-start.md %})** - Your first examples

## Overview

Fortified LLM Client provides two main interfaces:

- **CLI tool** (`fortified-llm-client`) - Command-line interface for quick LLM interactions
- **Rust library** (`fortified_llm_client`) - Programmatic API for Rust applications

Both share the same core functionality: multi-provider support, security guardrails, PDF extraction, and token management.

## Next Steps

Start with [Prerequisites]({% link getting-started/prerequisites.md %}) to ensure your system is ready, then move to [Installation]({% link getting-started/installation.md %}).
